This folder countains the necessary source files to re-implement an SSAES444 on a SAKURA G board (both FPGAs, in each sub-folder).
This SSAES444 implementation processes a single operation per clock cycle. This is to simplify the power analysis. Any other SSAES444 implementation can be used.
If needed, you can contact me at mael.gay@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de to get different implementations.
